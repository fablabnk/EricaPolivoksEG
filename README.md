# TODO

no + - on TL074's in original schematic! Follow pin numbers!
are jacks switched/normalled?
LED orientation check
What are purpose of labels?

Some components are marked as NU (not used) – leave those unpopulated!
- there is only one "Place 39K for -5V ... +5V output on INV EG OUT
Some components are market as OPTION (those are for optional modifications) – leave those unpopulated for now.

- DONE: NB! We observed that when the EG OUT is connected to certain VCAs, the looping may stop. In order to make looping more stable, replace R38 by 2,7k resistor!
- check we have 2.8k resistor!

do not mix NPN and PNP!

What are TP labels for? Can only presume they are useless!
