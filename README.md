# Build Notes

- 2N3094 and 2N3096 have been abbreviated to 4 and 6 respectively

# TODO

are pots supposed to be ADRS from top to bottom not ADSR. No, you fucked up!!
no + - on TL074's in original schematic! Follow pin numbers!
are jacks switched/normalled?
redo BOM - check we have 2.7k resistor!

DONE: check diameter of radial caps
DONE: removed TP labels from schematic, can only presume they are useless!
DONE: removed pro power features: polyfuses, reverse polarity protection and inductors
DONE: LED orientation check

Some components are marked as NU (not used) – leave those unpopulated!
- there is only one "Place 39K for -5V ... +5V output on INV EG OUT
Some components are market as OPTION (those are for optional modifications) – leave those unpopulated for now.

- DONE: NB! We observed that when the EG OUT is connected to certain VCAs, the looping may stop. In order to make looping more stable, - DONE: replace R38 by 2,7k resistor!


do not mix NPN and PNP!
